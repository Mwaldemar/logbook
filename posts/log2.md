### **Second logbook from my internship in Trendhim ðŸš€**

In my second week at Trendhim, I finished creating my logbook-website on Monday.

After finishing my logbook, i started doing tasks for the website again. In this task i were to move the return policy to the cart summary as seen in the picture below, which meant i had to create a new React-component, which is a framework that utilizes JavaScript and HTML, to make "building-block" for websites. For the design of the tasks, the engineering team collaborates a lot with another team called "Shopper Experience", which gives us tasks that we are to implement. So the new component had to be of the same style that the other components in the cart summary are.

During the week i did manage to solve the task and put it on github for review, but the change has not went live yet.

My next task was to remove some text from the payment option in the footer section of the website and then add shipping logos as shown in the picture below, to show customers what shipping is available. Parts of this task was not available yet, but i still made it, so it's ready for when the information needed is available. I had to create another React component, that used a promise to resolve some logos from the shipping companies and then the useState hook to set the data for the logos and the useEffect hook to simulate an asynchronous call. This task i also finished, but the data needed will not be ready before week 3, where it becomes more complex and i will finish it in collaboration with my mentor.

After this task i was cleaning up some styling documents and removing parts that are not used for the website anymore. My mentor prepared me different styling documents, that became increasingly comprehensive and harder to clean up, but i managed to finish some of it before the week ended.
