### **First logbook from my internship in Trendhim ðŸš€**

In my first week at Trendhim, I dove headfirst into a lot of new programs, services, and faces. It was a bit overwhelming at first, but what stood out was the laid-back vibe and the incredibly helpful team.

Right off the bat, I got my hands on some real tasks for the Trendhim website. I was to find specific bits of code and styling, which also gave me an introduction to the huge application that this website is, and then do small changes to make it look nicer, and then put those changes to the test across different platforms like mobile, tablets, and desktop. Furthermore, i was to utilize github to push my changes to a branch on the main project, so that it could be incorporated into the website, after reviews by team members.

The picture below shows my first change that went live on the actual website, where the text inside the red-marked boxes were not completely centered.

After the introduction and my first task, i went to my second task, which was to adjust the wishlist button. The wishlist button is the heart which can also be seen in the picture above. It had some hover-effect that had to be changed. It turned out to be quite a mouthful and i spent a long time working on it and almost had a solution, but i couldnt make the last part work. I eventually asked my mentor for help, and we then did it in collaboration, where he showed me the way he would attack the problem, which gave a good insight into what can be done to solve this task and similar tasks.

Besides trying to work my way around the application and making changes, i had several meetings with my mentor, where he introduced me to how the application works and how i could try to think before solving tasks/problems by doing sketches that will help me understand what part i should change.

After this i was given some other tasks that gave me a better understanding of how the whole application worked and how to solve future tasks. Furthermore, i was asked to make this website, which could serve as a logbook for my internship in Trendhim.

In general it was a really good week and i'm already learning a lot!
